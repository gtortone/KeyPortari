# 🕹️⌨️ The KeyPortari a 2600/7800 Keyboard Interface

This project enables the connection of a PS/2 keyboard (or a USB keyboard that supports the PS/2 protocol) to the Atari 2600 or 7800 console. The ATmega328P processes keystrokes and controls the joystick inputs of the Atari 2600 accordingly.

## ✨ Features
- **PS/2 Keyboard Support**: Supports various keyboard layouts (DE, US, FR).
- **Direct ASCII Conversion**: Translates keystrokes into Atari 2600-compatible signals.
- **Configurable Keymaps**: Customizable key assignments for Atari 2600 control.
- **Efficient GPIO Usage**: Utilizes an 8-bit port for direct control.
- **Configurable DIP Switches**: 4-bit resistor-ladder circuit for easy configuration.

## 🔌 Hardware Requirements
- **ATmega328P 5V 16Mhz (Arduino-compatible)**
- **PS/2 Keyboard (or USB Keyboard that supports the PS/2 protocol)**
- **Resistors for Resistor-Ladder (10kΩ, 20kΩ, 40kΩ, 80kΩ, 100kΩ Pull-up)**
- **2x Quad analog switch (74HC4066)**
- **Joystick port connection for the Atari 2600**

## 🛠️ Sponsored by JLCPCB
PCB manufacturing for this project was kindly sponsored by [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/?from=KEYPORTARI) – a leading PCB prototype service.
For the first prototype run, [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/?from=KEYPORTARI) generously provided 15 SMD assembled test boards, helping to accelerate early hardware development.

If you’re a developer or hardware tinkerer and would like to experiment with the interface or contribute your own ideas, feel free to reach out to me via [AtariAge](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/380359-the-keyportari-a-keyboard-interface-for-the-atari-26007800/page/4/#findComment-5660044) – I’d be happy to provide a board to support your work.

## 🧪 Breadboard Setup (one joystick forwarded)
![Breadboard Setup with one joystick forwarded](https://github.com/Al-Nafuur/Keyboard-2600/blob/main/docs/Breadboard_v3.png)


## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. **Upload code to ATmega328P** (via Arduino IDE or AVRDUDE).
2. **Connect PS/2 keyboard** to the corresponding pins.
3. **Set DIP switches** for the desired configuration.
4. **Connect to the Atari 2600 joystick port**.

## 🎮 Usage
- Each keystroke on the PS/2 keyboard is translated into joystick controls for the Atari 2600.
- Modifier keys like `Shift`, `Ctrl`, and `Alt` influence the key output (e.g., uppercase/lowercase characters).
- DIP switches can be used to activate different keyboard layout (US,DE,FR) configurations.
